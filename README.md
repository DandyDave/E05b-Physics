In this assignment for Game Technology at Indiana University I went through preassigned code and aadded or changed physics.

In main1.py I added gravity to the the balls.

In main2.py I added gravity again and made the balls bouncce by reversing thier velocity when they come into ccontact whith a surface.

In main3.py I adjusted the collision making it somewhat more realistic by subtraccting the velocities of the two objects ccolliding instead of just inversing thier velocity.
